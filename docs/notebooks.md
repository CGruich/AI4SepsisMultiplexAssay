# Notebooks

These notebooks are the notebooks used to train the models for MIDAS, as well as perform the Bayesian hyperparameter search of these models.

These notebooks are ordered (1) onwards in the intended order to reproducibly train the models.

Notebooks that are marked **OPTIONAL** are notebooks that were used to initialize the study (such as, determining MSER parameters or using MSER to crop out particles from the raw assay images to initialize making a dataset)

These notebooks are not necessary to reproduce the results of the work because their outputs are included in the repository but nevertheless are included for completeness.
